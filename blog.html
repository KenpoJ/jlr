		<h3><a href="#">Presenting Cohort 7, Summer 2017</a></h3>

		<p class="category"><strong>Categories:</strong> Cohort Announcements</p>
		<p class="tags">accelerators, automotive tech, incubators, mobility, security, Simplenight, startups, tech incubator, Tyfone</p>
	</aside>
	<p>We guess the old adage “Time flies when you’re having fun” is true, because although it seems like just last week we announced Cohort 6, it wasn’t. Three months have passed and we’ve officially welcomed two new companies into our program.</p>
	<p>On July 24th, Tyfone and SIMPLENIGHT joined us at the Jaguar Land Rover Tech Incubator, making up our seventh cohort since launching last year. </p>
	<p>In the hyper-connected digital world of cloud, mobility, and IoT (Internet of Things), legacy security methods have proven to be ineffective because they trade-off convenience for security and result in a fragmented array of solutions. This ineffectiveness and fragmentation affects ease of access to everything from financial services to connected cars.</p>
	<p>Enter Tyfone, with the goal of bringing digital security that is convenient and converged. By inventing energy efficient technologies, Tyfone brings the security of chips in your credit card to the convenience of using your mobile phones through its patented SideCard™ product. SideCard packs security, radio and battery technologies in an easy to carry ultra-thin credit card form factor that otherwise would be 25 times larger. With a simple push of a button it delivers the highest level of security sufficient for military grade applications without the need for complex passwords and cumbersome enrollment.</p>
	<p>Tyfone currently has 140 issued and pending patents, and serves key industries with converged omnichannel security needs such as financial services, critical infrastructure, transportation, and the US Government.</p>
	<p>As cars become increasingly connected, shared and autonomous, the transportation industry will become the hub for enabling a variety of payment and commerce services. Such services require both security and convenience – not trading-off one for the other. When it comes to connected cars, Jaguar Land Rover is always looking for new ways to increase security and convenience for its customers. Tyfone’s solution provides opportunities to explore secure access to connected cars, as well as secure enrollment into apps for transportation services. By collaborating with Tyfone, Jaguar Land Rover hopes to provide customers with a wide range of personalized transportation services that are secure, “push button,” and convenient.</p>
